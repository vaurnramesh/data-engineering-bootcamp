# Setup 
- I'm using `pgadmin` to run the sql code

- Made changes to the makefile as `docker-compose` is changed to `docker compose` in the docker compose 2. This way the makefile is runnable.

- Forked this repo and have set the upstream repo to fetch.

Run `git fetch upstream` to get the latest changes from the upstream branch.git and then run `git rebase upstream/main` to get the local changes in.
